        <h1>Web Application Programming and Hacking</h1>
        <p>Instructor: Dr. Phu Phung</p>
        <p>This course involves hands-on projects related to front-end web development.</p>
        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>In this course, students will study basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS)
            and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and explored with
            hands-on exercises. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid potential web
            application vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>
        <h3>Topics (Tentative)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Web and Web Applications</li>
            <li>Client-side Web Development with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
            <li>Server-side Web Application Development with PHP and Database (MySQL)</li>
            <li>Version control (git)</li>
            <li>Web Application Security: Vulnerabilities and Attacks with Hands-on Exercises</li>
            <li>Secure Web Programming Principles and Practices</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Course Goals and Objectives</h3>
        <p>Students will gain the ability and skills to effectively use state-of-the-art techniques in web application
            development and security tools for the analysis, design, and implementation of secure web systems. They will
            enhance their programming skills to develop secure, robust, sustainable software products, establish
            security analysis skills to identify and avoid potential web vulnerabilities, and apply practical knowledge
            of security in designing and implementing web applications with contemporary programming technologies.</p>
        <h3>Assessments and Grading Policy</h3>
        <p>Your performance and course outcomes will be assessed via class/video participation, multiple-choice quizzes
            (weekly), hands-on lab exercises (4), hackathon exercises (4), individual projects (2), a team project, and
            a multiple-choice final exam.</p>
