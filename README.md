## Overview 

In this project, I was tasked with using what I learned from lab 2 and turning it into a portfolio type website. I learned a lot with this project, especially how to translate everything I have learned into react and how to use github.io to make a live website. More details about the features are below. 

## Task 1: Create and deploy a personal website on GitHub cloud (github.io) as a professional profile with your resume, including your name, headshot, contact information, background, e.g., education, your experiences and skills

For this part, I followed the lecture to learn how to use the Github cloud. It was difficult getting it linked with VS Code, but I eventually got it to work. I also decided that I wanted to use ReactJS because it is much easier to use and I can see my life changes on the site.
