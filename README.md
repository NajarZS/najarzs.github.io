## Overview 

In this project, I was tasked with using what I learned from lab 2 and turning it into a portfolio type website. I learned a lot with this project, especially how to translate everything I have learned into react and how to use github.io to make a live website. More details about the features are below. 

## Task 1: Create and deploy a personal website on GitHub cloud (github.io) as a professional profile with your resume, including your name, headshot, contact information, background, e.g., education, your experiences and skills

For this part, I followed the lecture to learn how to use the Github cloud. It was difficult getting it linked with VS Code, but I eventually got it to work. I also decided that I wanted to use ReactJS because it is much easier to use and I can see my live changes on the site. For my resume, I decided to turn it into a button that opens it in a pdf viewer because pasting my entire resume onto the resume was very messy and ugly. I then just pasted the basic info and added paragraphs about my background and education. For the skills, I used the progress bars like what was shown from the example screenshot in the lecture. I thought they were very cool.

## Task 2: Create a link to a new HTML page to introduce this "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and related hands-on projects (5 pts)​

For this part, I decided to make a hyperlink that just opens a new page on the website with the general course info pasted from the syllabus. I then added the option to view the full syllabus just like I did with the resume. I then added a button that takes you back to the homepage. 

## Task 3: Use an open-source CSS template or framework such as Bootstrap​

This part was very simple as I had to just use what I learned from lab 2. I opted for a modern, aesthetic look to make it look professional and not too flashy. 

## Task 4: Include a page tracker

This part was tedious because it involved me having to make a google analytics accounts and then answer the annoying questions. I then had to learn how to properly use the page tracker which resulted in a lot of research on google. I did not like this part, and I am still not sure what the page tracker does. 

## Task 5: Use jQuery and one more open-source JavaScript framework/library​ to implement JavaScript code introduced in Lab 2, including a digital clock, an analog clock, show/hide your email, and one more functionality of your choice

In this part, I used most of the code from Lab 2. However, since I decided to use ReactJS as my second JS framework, I had to learn how to properly translate all the code. The clock had the most problems because it would not display correctly. Adding everything else was pretty simple. jQuery is used in the joke api and I decided to add the age guesser as my extra functionality. 

## Task 6: Integrate the jokeAPI

This part was simple because I just had to use what I learned from lab 2. I changed the category from any and made sure the jQuery was working correctly so that I could incorpoate that part. 

## Task 7: Integrate a public API with graphics and display that graphic/image in your page.

For this part, I could not use the exmaple apis because it was requesting some weird permissions that I could not figure out how to fix. I kept testing with different apis that would load their images correctly until I came across the random chart api. It just displays a random chart. 

## Task 8: Use JavaScript cookies to remember the client 

For this final part, I also just followed the lecture and used some research from google. I think this part is very cool and it helped me understand cookies more.
